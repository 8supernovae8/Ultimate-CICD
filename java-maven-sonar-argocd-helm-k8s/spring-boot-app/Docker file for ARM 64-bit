if we use linux/arm64 argitecture then docker file should like below 

# Use the official OpenJDK 11 Alpine image for ARM 64-bit
FROM adoptopenjdk:11-jdk-hotspot-bionic

# Simply the artifact path
ARG artifact=target/spring-boot-web.jar

WORKDIR /opt/app

COPY ${artifact} app.jar

# This should not be changed
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
